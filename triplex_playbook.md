# Triplex Monitor - Master Playbook

## Vision
Triplex Monitor is the beginning of a self-organizing, resilient, scalable system designed to monitor, log, and analyze real-world events across multiple sectors (political, financial, medical, technological).

We aim to combine:
- Event tracking (Breaks, Recoveries, Growth)
- Synthetic data generation
- Metrics, analytics, and reporting
- Seamless integration with Google Sheets and other databases
- Strategic scalability into IoT, Quantum Resistance, Blockchain, and AI ecosystems

This is **Chapter 2, Volume 1** — the foundation of a much larger infrastructure.

## Phase 1 - Logging and Basic Automation
- ✅ **monitor.py**: Log Break, Recovery, Growth events
- ✅ Auto-create `logs/` folder and `.txt` files
- ✅ Run interactively via Colab, Replit, local machine
- ✅ Manual event input
- ✅ Prepare basic synthetic event generation
- ✅ Connect prototype output to Google Sheets
